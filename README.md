# Amazon-App-For-PC
Hi,
You can know more about me [here](https://anonymousxc.github.io/ItsMeOnly/).\
So,
- I wanted to keep this repository private but no one could access it with url too.
- ***This is unofficial app. This is made to make it official.*** 
- This is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. 
- I have test this app on Windows. 
- I prefer using a Windows computer to see its full functionality. 
- This app is not tested by buying anything. 
- I also added dark theme somehow in this app.

## Why This!
After searching a bit in the microsoft store. I found that Flipkart, Instagram, Facebook and etc have their apps but Amazon does not have its shopping app.
But Amazon has prime video app. So, I decided to make the app. \
As Its been about 2 years while I am coding with zero results so, I thought to give it a try. \
I hope u liked it.

## Plans
If the response is positive. \
Then, I would like to add
- Custom Title Bar
- Better Security
- And, many more things.
